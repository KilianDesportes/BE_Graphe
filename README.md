This entire git is a usable *Eclipse* project.

Almost all the sources of the project were provided to us at the beginning of the project.

The goal of the project was to implement the Dijkstra and A* algorithms to perform a shorter path calculation on several maps. We also performed validation and performance tests of our algorithms using the JUnit framework.

The algorithms we have developed can be found in: *src/main/org/insa/algo/shortestpath/*
* DijkstraAlgorithm.java
* AStarAlgorithm.java

and the tests in: *src/test/org/insa/graph/*
* DijkstraAlgorithmTest.java
* AStarAlgorithmTest.java

The cards needed for the tests are not available in this git because of their large sizes.
